# Snowballer (FLAME GAME JAM 3.0 Entry)

## Main theme (everyone has this): Hot & Cold

## Limitations (choose one)

- Single Button Input
- Multiple Endings
- No text

I've chosen single button input. All the player needs to do is tap on the screen to change the direction of the character. The play also has to tap on the screen to start the game.

## How to play

You are a snowball called Snowballer. The object of the game is to explore the world and try to escape while collecting as many things as possible. However, watch out for lava and enemies called Flarics because you'll melt the instant that you come in contact with one of those.

## How to Control Snowballer

Just tap the screen the Snowballer will change direction clockwise.
